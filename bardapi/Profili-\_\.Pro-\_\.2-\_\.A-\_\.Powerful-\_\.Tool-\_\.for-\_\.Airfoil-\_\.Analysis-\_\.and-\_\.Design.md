In this article, we will review some of the main features of Profili Pro 2 and how they can benefit you in your airfoil projects.
 
## What is Profili Pro 2?
 
Profili Pro 2 is a software that allows you to create, edit, analyze and optimize airfoils using various methods and tools. You can import airfoil data from different sources, such as DAT files, coordinates, images or scanned drawings. You can also generate new airfoils by mixing different parts of existing ones, or by using the functions of XFoil, a powerful computational fluid dynamics code that is integrated in Profili Pro 2.
 
Once you have your airfoil data, you can perform various analyses on it, such as polar curves, lift and drag coefficients, pressure distribution, transition points, boundary layer thickness, etc. You can also compare different airfoils on the same graph and export the results to various formats. You can also use Profili Pro 2 to design and optimize wing sections and wing panels for your model aircraft or glider. You can define the geometry, twist, dihedral and washout of your wing and calculate its aerodynamic performance. You can also print or export your wing design to DXF or raster files.
 
## What are the advantages of Profili Pro 2?
 
Profili Pro 2 has many advantages over other airfoil software. Some of them are:
 
- It has a large database of more than 2300 airfoils that you can access and use for your projects. You can also create your own libraries and manage them easily.
- It has no limit on the range of angle of attack for polar analysis. You can also define your own Reynolds number and Mach number for each polar.
- It has a powerful interface with XFoil that allows you to use its functions directly from Profili Pro 2. You can modify the shape, camber and thickness of your airfoil using MDES, GDES, QDES and PPAR menus. You can also evaluate the effect of external roughness on your airfoil performance.
- It has a flexible and user-friendly interface that allows you to customize your preferences and settings. You can also use different languages and units for your input and output.
- It has a comprehensive help system that explains each function and option in detail. You can also access online tutorials and support from the developer's website.
