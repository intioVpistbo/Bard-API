In this article, we will compare Revoice Pro and VocAlign Ultra in terms of features, workflow, price and compatibility, and help you decide which one suits your needs better.
  
## Features
  
Revoice Pro and VocAlign Ultra share some common features, such as:
  
- The ability to align the timing and pitch of two different signals, such as a lead vocal and a backing vocal.
- The option to adjust the tightness and offset of the alignment.
- The use of advanced algorithms that preserve the natural sound and expression of the original vocals.
- The support for ARA2 technology, which allows seamless integration with compatible DAWs like Logic Pro and Studio One.

However, Revoice Pro has some additional features that VocAlign Ultra does not have, such as:

- A pitch and timing editor that allows you to make fine adjustments to the pitch and timing of individual notes or syllables.
- A doubler function that can create natural-sounding double tracks from a single vocal track.
- A process groups feature that lets you change the alignment settings for a collection of vocals or instruments even after capturing them.
- A Revoice Link plug-in that enables you to transfer audio between Revoice Pro and your DAW with a simple drag-and-drop.

## Workflow
  
Another major difference between Revoice Pro and VocAlign Ultra is their workflow. VocAlign Ultra is a plug-in that works inside your DAW. As a plug-in, VocAlign Ultra requires no file management. Everything is saved and recalled with your DAW project. You can use VocAlign Ultra on any track or bus in your DAW, and apply it to multiple doubles at the same time. You can also use it with RePitch, another plug-in from Synchro Arts that offers pitch correction and manipulation.
  
Revoice Pro is a standalone app that works separately alongside your DAW. Revoice Pro projects are saved and recalled independently. You can use Revoice Pro with any DAW, but you need to use plug-ins or audio files to transfer audio between Revoice Pro and your DAW. You can also use Revoice Pro on any type of audio, not just vocals. For example, you can use it to align guitars, brass or drums.
  
## Price and Compatibility
  
VocAlign Ultra costs $399 USD for a perpetual license or $9.99 USD per month for a subscription. It comes bundled with RePitch, a pitch correction and manipulation plug-in. VocAlign Ultra is compatible with Mac OS 10.13 or higher and Windows 10 or higher. It supports VST3, AU and AAX formats, as well as ARA2 technology.
  
Revoice Pro costs $599 USD for a perpetual license or $14.99 USD per month for a subscription. It comes with Revoice Link, a plug-in that enables easy audio transfer between Revoice Pro and your DAW. Revoice Pro is compatible with Mac OS 10.9 or higher and Windows 8 or higher. It supports VST3, AU and AAX formats, as well as ARA2 technology.
  
## Conclusion
  
Revoice Pro and VocAlign Ultra are both powerful tools for vocal alignment and pitch correction. They have some common features, but also some significant differences in terms of functionality, workflow, price and compatibility. Depending on your needs and preferences, you might find one more suitable than the other.
  
If you are looking for a fast and easy plug-in-based solution that works inside your DAW, VocAlign Ultra might be the best choice for you. It offers advanced alignment technology that can handle multiple doubles at once, as well as pitch correction and manipulation with RePitch.
